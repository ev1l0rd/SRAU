Samus Returns Amiibo Unlocker

Unlock amiibo-gated content for Samus Returns.

Includes a toggle for enabling Fusion mode.

## Usage
Make sure you have Metroid II: Samus Returns installed for your console's region. Install the CIA or run the 3dsx. Then follow the instructions on screen. You can press START at any time to exit.

## Compiling
Make sure the latest devKitPro is installed, then just run `make`.

## Known issues
If you don't have SR installed or are trying to unlock a non-existing save file, the program will display an error message.

Doesn't unlock the Concept Galleries or the Sound Test (yet).

## Thanks to
This homebrew application wouldn't have been possible without help from the following people:

* **LiquidFenrir**, for linking me to a guide to C that actually worked for me, helping me when I got stuck and just for being an awesome friend in general. Without him, I'd still be saying "well someday I'll start learning C and make a 3DS tool".
* daedreth, for helping me with ctrulib and for testing on an install without SR installed.
* All of the following people in one way or another for helping me keep being motivated to work on this, even if that was indirectly: astronautlevel, HM892, TurtleP, Phoenix, Derpta, Corin, bernardogiordano, Stary, Lily and any other folks I may have missed. Seriously, you guys are awesome.
