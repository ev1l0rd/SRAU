## Thanks to
This homebrew application wouldn't have been possible without help from the following people:

* **[LiquidFenrir](https://github.com/LiquidFenrir)**, for linking me to a guide to C that actually worked for me, helping me when I got stuck and just for being an awesome friend in general. Without him, I'd still be saying "well someday I'll start learning C and make a 3DS tool".
* [daedreth](https://github.com/daedreth), for helping me with ctrulib and for testing on an install without SR installed.
* [Sonlen1414](https://github.com/Sonlen1414), for beta testing.
* All of the following people in one way or another for helping me keep being motivated to work on this, even if that was indirectly: astronautlevel, HM892, TurtleP, Phoenix, Derpta, Corin, bernardogiordano, Stary, Lily and any other folks I may have missed. Seriously, you guys are awesome.
